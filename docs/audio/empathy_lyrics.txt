So shattered, worlds collide and die
Don't preach to me it's justified
Just illusions why you never see the stake
The riots, the lies, the power that they seek
Two-faced leaders turn their back on empathy
They crushed the hope, the dream
In anarchy, we find our voice, scream out loud
Wake up, rise up, it's time to break the chains
False prophets fuel the fire of our disdain
Burning flags, the embers of democracy
We're the pawns, in their game, the lost majority
[Chorus]
Shout for the silenced, fight for the free
We're the renegades, this system's broken, flawed
Ignited spirits, we won't be overawed
Cast off the shadows, expose the hidden lies
We're storming the streets 'cause freedom never dies
In the chaos, our unity becomes the key
Together we stand, a force of anarchy
The skyline's burning, red with righteous hate
Defiant fists, against the iron gate
Lost democracy, the truth that they betray
With each decision, our rights they strip away
Power mongers play, with lives like they're a game
But from the ashes, we ignite the flame
Look around (look around), chaos reigns, it's a mess
Truth's a ghost, barely seen, lost in the press
Fat cats dine, while we choke on their greed
Revolution's call, planting freedom's seed
[Verse]
Spreading lies, theyâ€™re spinning webs so vile
In the shadows, they plot and they defile
Now listen up (listen up), it's the rebels' cry
Kicking down doors, it's our turn to defy
Dark clouds loom, but we spit out the rain
Our will is a wall, outlasting their pain
Ground shakes, we're wide awake, no more fake alibis
We're the voice of the streets, throwing truth at the lies
